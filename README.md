# Libox controller (WIP + experimental, like mooncontroller)

- Fork of mooncontroller, that makes use of helper functions from libox

# Differences

- Most of the environment is already handled by libox (this also means you get more stuff to play with, like `pcall` and `loadstring`, and also get traceback)
- Code isn't limited by instructions but by a time limit


Code:
- LGPLv3, most of it is taken from https://github.com/mt-mods/mooncontroller
