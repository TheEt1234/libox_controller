Lua Functions
=============

Most of the standard lua environment is derived from libox, see https://github.com/TheEt1234/libox/blob/master/env_docs.md

But libox_controller adds some things on top of it:
* pin - the mesecons INPUT table
* port - the mesecons OUTPUT table
* event - the reason why the libox controller ran
* mem - persistant storage of values, unserializable stuff isn't allowed in there
* heat - the amount of events executed on this libox controller per second
* heat_max - if heat is above this value the libox_controller will overheat
* pos - the libox controller's position,
* print(text, no_new_line) - prints the text to the terminal, 
-   * optionally when no_new_line is enabled it won't print out a new line...
-   * if given a table, it creates a readable representation
* clearterm() - clears the terminal
* interrupt(time, iid, lightweight) - starts a timer
-   * once it has finished it will send an interrupt event
-   * that interrupt event has an iid field, that just returns the iid
-   * iid must be a string, that's less than 256 characters
-   * if lightweight mode is enabled, it will use node timers instead of mesecons queue 
-   * (this helps save server resources by not executing when the controller is unloaded, may even be forced by a setting)
-   * iid and lightweight arguments are optional
* digiline_send(channel, msg) - sends a digiline message 
* conf - The libox_controller configuration
* code - The code that the luacontroller has been loaded with
* require - Adds a library from another mod (currently unused)
