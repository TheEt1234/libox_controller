Digilines
=========

If the digilines mod is installed, then Luacontrollers can also send/receive digilines signals.

To send a digilines signal, use the digiline_send() function.
Example:
digiline_send("lcd","Hello") --Sends the message "Hello" on the channel "lcd"

Please note that digilines messages are sent from all pins, and there is no need or ability to select one.

When a digilines signal is received, an event occurs.
Example:
{
	type = "digiline",
	channel = "lcd",
	msg = "Hello"
}

Oh and also, if enabled (not by default), libox controllers can send functions in digiline messages
BUT, when transmitting functions, keep in mind that it will have no environment, you will have to make a function like this:

function i_am_gonna_send_this(env)
	env.digiline_send("stuff","stuff")
	env.math.exp(1)
	env.print("HI")
end
