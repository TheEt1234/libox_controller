Digilines
=========

If the digilines mod is installed, then Luacontrollers can also send/receive digilines signals.

To send a digilines signal, use the digiline_send() function.
Example:
digiline_send("lcd","Hello") --Sends the message "Hello" on the channel "lcd"

Please note that digilines messages are sent from all pins, and there is no need or ability to select one.

When a digilines signal is received, an event occurs.
Example:
{
	type = "digiline",
	channel = "lcd",
	msg = "Hello"
}

Oh and also,
digiline_send("message", { function() end }, true)

- digiline messages can transmit functions now
- the digiline message doesn't need to be copied now 
	- (yes this allows communication with tables, that is way more efficent than using digiline wire and way more fun)

BUT, when transmitting functions, keep in mind that it will have no environment, you will have to make a function like this:

function i_am_gonna_send_this(ENV)
	ENV.digiline_send("stuff","stuff")
	ENV.math.exp(1)
	ENV.print("HI")
end
